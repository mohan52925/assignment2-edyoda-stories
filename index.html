                <h2>Challenges of Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics</h2>
                <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp| 24 apr 2023;</p>
                <p>Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract value from big data and provide data analytics. Machine learning is the ability to learn from data, provide insights, predictions, suggestions from data which help in the decision-making process. Big Data revolves around large volumes of information and analytics. In short, Big Data is analyzing large amounts of data which is a very time-consuming task for humans. It is crucial to understand the process behind the analysis of big data. In simple terms, at the beginning machine models start learning from the sample data we provide them and then, after analyzing the results, it provides the information you were looking for. Recently, it is observed that the size of big data has been increasing day-by-day by large numbers. With increasing numbers comes increasing challenges. </p>

                <h2>Impact of Cloud Computing in various industries</h2>
                <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp| 24 April 2023;</p>
                <p>Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud.</p>

                <h2>Cyber Security: Analysis of the digital world</h2>
                <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 24 Apr 2023</p>
                <p>When computers were standalone devices, security was a minimal concern. Mainframes had their own protected facilities. Slowly and steadily as computing became more personal, security became the personal responsibility too. The use of computers increasingly involves networks of computers for messaging, on-line transactions, remote hosting. It started including the opportunities for the attack which have multiplied exponentially. Arriving at the security part became a major concern to drive out businesses well and generate revenues without leading to the losses due to the breach of security

                    Cybersecurity has become a major concern of businesses and governments. As the data saved of clouds and other means has the exposure us to hackers, business competitors and other predators with malicious intent. Cyber breaches have led to many damages including, public property and loss of life. Data breach affects large MNCs, small and medium enterprises in a very harmful way. It would lead access to confidential information, accounts which can be viewed, copied or used by anyone with harmful intention.</p>

                <h2>LAMP Stack Vs MEAN stack: Choosing the right platform for your web application development</h2>
                <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 24 Apr 2024</p>
                <p>In today’s dynamic world, rapid web application development with a smooth user interface that can adapt to specific features is the main business requirement. Many organizations around the world that intensely depend on programming for their everyday business operations, the big business level applications, sites and servers have become apparent. It is important to use consistent, scalable and standardized software when developing a new application.

                    A web stack is a collection of software that is used to build a web application. Many E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Walmart and eBay provide the best user experience which is one of the reasons why they maintain their position at the top. Currently, the most popular web stacks are: LAMP stack and MEAN stack.</p>

                <h2>Importance of Data Backup and Recovery in the IT industry</h2>
                <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 24 Apr 2024</p>
                <p>A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order to bring about a positive change in the work environment. One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is necessary for every business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and computers should conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a boon in any point of time. 

                    Before moving forward, let us understand the concept of Data Backup and Recovery.
                    
                    Backup is the process of creating and storing copies of data that is confidential to the organization against the data loss or in case of emergency. Recovery is the process that involves restoring the lost data to the original location or another location. It is essential to have a proper backup copy in a separate system. It is the duty of every employee to keep the data structured and backed up in a separate storage device and not to hand it over to somebody else as it has confidential information.</p>

                <h2>Introduction To A Machine Learning Online Course</h2>
                <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 24 Apr 2024</p>
                <p>We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.</p>
